# Fix a broken guide program
## Introduction
This repository was created and being maintained with almost no knowledge of html/css/js. One of us found a guide to start with the basics.
Instead, we struggled to even run the program, because after following all steps in the guide, the browser showed nothing!

## Purpose
Purpose of this repository is to practice and have fun, since we are trying to make this code work as it was intended by the author.

* You can checkout the first commit and see the condition of a self proclaimed "programming guide" :)
